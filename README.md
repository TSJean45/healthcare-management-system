<h1>ONGOING FYP</h1>

<h1>Project Objective</h1>
<li><b>To provide an online appointment system for medical users to book their appointments</b><br></li>
A streamlined appointment scheduling system that enables medical users to book appointments online rather than in person. Additionally, this methodology eliminates the need for medical staff to manage appointments manually, which can become onerous. It has a simple user interface that requires important data input from the user. As a result, medical users would find the system simple to navigate and comprehend.<br><br>
<li><b>To provide a medical record management system to store medical user’s medical records</b><br></li>
Keeping medical user medical records online, when integrated into the healthcare management system, will be immensely advantageous for medical staff, as it will minimise the need for them to sift through hundreds of papers stored in the file cabinet. This approach has the advantage of being less time consuming and less cluttered than the previous one. When medical staff log into the healthcare management system, they can easily locate and preserve a medical user's medical record. This is a more efficient method because it has the potential to speed the procedure, resulting in a shorter wait time.<br><br></li>
<li><b>To provide a medicine stock management system to record the medicine stock available in a healthcare organisation</b><br>
This system assists medical staff in ensuring that adequate medicine stock is always available and that insufficient medicine stock will always be restocked in the minimum time possible to avoid healthcare being overwhelmed by shortages. Additionally, the staff may guarantee that the shelf life of each medication supply is maintained, ensuring that no medicine stock is wasted. Medical staff can key in the usages of medicine in a day, informing other staff of the quantity of medicine stock available at the time of selection, hence decreasing manual time wasted.<br>
